## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

[Ecoleta](https://ecoleta-nlw-starter.herokuapp.com/) is web app for a fictional startup to find recycle colletion points on your city.

The Full MVC system was developed between June 1st and 8nd 2020 as an Project Based Approach to teach HTML, CSS, Front-end JavaScript and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (with [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com/) and [Nunjucks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks)) to aspiring web developers.

The front-end consists of 3 pages:

- Home-page - Startup Presentation
- Collection Point Register - To insert the collection point into the database for user retrieval
- Collection Point Search - Search By City

The back-end:

- Server is made with express and nunjucks template engine
- Database is sqlite3 for insertion of new collect points.
